            <p>The 1967 Six-Day War was triggered during a volatile period of diplomatic friction and skirmishes between Israel and its neighbors. In April 1967, 
                the clashes worsened after Israel and Syria fought a ferocious air and artillery engagement in which six Syrian fighter jets were destroyed. 
                <br>
                <br>In the wake of the April air battle, the Soviet Union provided Egypt with intelligence that Israel was moving troops to its northern border with Syria in preparation for a full-scale invasion. 
                The information was inaccurate, but it nevertheless stirred Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser to advance forces into the Sinai Peninsula, 
                where they expelled a United Nations peacekeeping force that had been guarding the border with Israel for over a decade.
                <br>Israel Defense Forces then launched a preemptive aerial attack against Egypt on June 5, 1967. 
                Both nations claimed that they were acting in self-defense in the ensuing conflict, which ended on June 10 and also drew in Jordan and Syria, who sided with Egypt. 
                The Six-Day War, as it came to be called, resulted in major land gains for Israel.<br>
                <br>By the end of the war, Israel had taken control of the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, the Sinai Peninsula (a desert region situated between the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea) 
                and the Golan Heights (a rocky plateau located between Syria and modern-day Israel).<br>
                <br> The outcome of the 1967 Arab-Israeli War would lead to continued tension and armed conflict between Israel and its neighbors over the coming decades.<br>

                The 1978 Camp David Accords brought a formal peace between Israel and Egypt that included a return of the Sinai Peninsula and called for 
                further negotiations about Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.<br>
                <br>

                In 2006, Hamas, a Sunni Islamist militant group, won the Palestinian legislative elections.<br>
                <br>
                That same year, fighting between Hamas and Fatah, the political group that controlled the PLO, ensued. In 2007, Hamas defeated Fatah in a battle for Gaza..<br>
                <br>
                Hamas has perpetrated terrorist tactics, including carrying out suicide bombings, 
                conducting deadly raids on military and civilian targets and repeatedly calling for the destruction of Israel.<br>
                <br>Hamas and Israel have fought each other in several bloody conflicts, including in 2008, 2012 and 2014.<br>
                <br>In April 2014, Hamas and Fatah agreed to a deal that would form a unified national Palestinian government, 
                but continuing power struggles between the major parties led to its full dissolution by 2019. 
                That left Fatah dominant in the West Bank and Hamas in full control of the Gaza Strip.<br>

            <h1>The First Intifada and the Oslo Accords</h1>
            <img src="..\recourses\what did the handshake bring.jpeg" alt="Descriptive Alt Text" class="mainImg">
            <p>In 1987, the First Intifada broke out, a boiling over of Palestinian anger over ongoing Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank. 
                Palestinian militia groups revolted, and hundreds of people were killed.
                <br>
                <br> A subsequent peace process, known as the Oslo Peace Accords, was initiated in 1993 in a multilateral attempt to end the ongoing violence. 
                <br>

                <img src="..\recourses\the first intifada.jpeg" alt="Descriptive Alt Text" class="secondmainImg">
                <br>
                <br> The first Oslo Accord (Oslo I) created a timetable for a Middle East peace process and a plan for an interim Palestinian government in parts of Gaza and the West Bank. 
                The agreement was signed in 1993 and witnessed by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. <br>
                <br>
                A new analysis by two United States-based researchers, Jamon Van Den Hoek and Corey Scher, 
                and Al Jazeera's AJ Labs unit showed that overall at least 16 percent of all buildings in the Gaza Strip have been destroyed. 
                In Gaza City alone, the building destruction reached at least 28 percent.
                <br>

                <br>
                <br> Arafat returned to Gaza in 1994 after being exiled for 27 years. He headed up the newly-formed Palestinian Authority<br>
                <br>
                In 1995, Oslo II laid the groundwork for a complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from parts of the West Bank and other areas. 
                It also set a schedule for Palestinian Legislative Council elections.
                The Oslo Accords ultimately failed to bring Israel and the Palestinians to an agreement over a full-fledged peace plan.

                <br>Same year, Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish extremist at a peace rally in Tel Aviv, and the Israeli-Palestinian peace process stalled under his successors: Shimon Peres, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Ehud Barak. 
                In September 2000, the worst violence since the end of the intifada erupted between Israelis and Palestinians after rightist Likud Party leader Ariel Sharon visited the Temple Mount, 
                a religious site in Jerusalem of great importance to both Jews and Muslims, the latter of whom control it. Seeking a strong leader to suppress the bloodshed, Israelis elected Sharon prime minister in February 2001. After suffering a stroke, he was replaced by his deputy, Ehud Olmert, in April 2006.

            <h2>The Second Intifada: Violence Continues</h2>
            <img src="..\recourses\second intifada.jpeg" alt="Descriptive Alt Text" class="aside-img">
            <p>In September 2000, the Second Palestinian Intifada began. One of the triggers for the violence was when Ariel Sharon, a right-wing, 
                Jewish Israeli who would later become Israel's prime minister, visited the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. 
                <br>
                <br>The highly contested site is sacred in Judaism as the location of the Hebrew Temples, and in Islam for its association with the Prophet Mohammed. 
                Many Palestinians felt this was an offensive and provocative move, and they protested. 
                Riots, suicide bombings and other attacks subsequently broke out, putting an end to the once-promising peace process.<br>
                <br>
                This period of violence between Palestinians and Israelis lasted nearly five years. 
                Yasser Arafat died in November 2004, and by August of 2005, the Israeli army withdrew from Gaza.
            </p>

            <h2>Current State of Palestine</h2>
            <img src="..\recourses\Current State of Palestine.jpeg" alt="Descriptive Alt Text" class="aside-img">
                <p>Although Palestinians occupy key areas of land, in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, some Israelis, with their government's blessing, continue to settle in areas that are generally agreed to be under Palestinian control. Many international rights groups consider such settlements illegal, and multiple UN resolutions have been passed backing that position. Borders aren’t clearly defined, and persistent conflict continues to be the norm. 
                    A substantial proportion of Israelis also oppose the settlements and would prefer to find peaceful ways to resolve their land disputes with the Palestinians.<br>
                    <br>
                    In May 2017, leaders of Hamas presented a new charter that proposed the formation of a Palestinian state using the 1967 defined borders, with Jerusalem as its capital. 
                    However, the group still refused to recognize Israel as a state, and the Israeli government promptly rejected the plan.<br>
                    <br>
                    In May 2018, tensions increased when the U.S. Embassy relocated from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Perceiving this as a signal of American support for Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Palestinians responded with widespread protests at the Gaza-Israel border. 
                    As protests escalated, Israeli forces responded with force, leading to the deaths of dozens of protesters.<br>
                    <br>
                    In October 2023, Hamas militants launched a coordinated terrorist assault on Israel, kidnapping more than 200 people and killing more than 1,000 Israelis,
                    many of them civilians, leading Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to declare "we are at war." 
                    Israel began retaliatory airstrikes in Gaza, leading to thousands of Palestinian deaths, including civilians.
